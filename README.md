2.Should countries with a lower life expectancy (below 65 years) increase healthcare expenditure to improve their population's lifespan?
3.How do infant and adult mortality rates influence life expectancy across different regions?
4.What is the relationship between life expectancy and lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption?
5.How does educational attainment, as measured by years of schooling, affect human lifespan?
6.Is there a positive or negative correlation between alcohol consumption and life expectancy?
7.What is the impact of immunization coverage on life expectancy, particularly regarding diseases like Hepatitis B, Polio, and Diphtheria?
